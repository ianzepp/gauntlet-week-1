👤 Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

📋 Model: opus-4.6
🤖 <analysis>
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. The user started by providing context: they had already read PRE-SEARCH.md and listed files in the Prior project directory. The user's request was: "new project, see @PRE-SEARCH.md . focus on backend requirements, skip auth. Explore @~/github/ianzepp/prior/ for referenced patterns to extract here"

2. I explored the Prior project extensively, reading key files:
   - kernel/src/frame.rs - Frame type, Status enum, constructors, builders
   - gateways/api/src/ws.rs - WebSocket handler with select! loop
   - gateways/api/src/lib.rs - Server startup
   - gateways/api/src/api.rs - AppState, Router, REST handlers
   - kernel/src/llm/client.rs - AnthropicClient
   - kernel/src/llm/openai_client.rs - OpenAiClient
   - kernel/src/llm/types.rs - LlmError, ContentBlock, Content, Message, Tool, ChatResponse
   - kernel/src/llm/mod.rs - LlmClient enum, dispatch
   - kernel/src/kernel/frame_db.rs - Append-only frame log
   - kernel/src/llm/trait_catalog.rs - Personality traits (not needed for CollabBoard)
   - kernel/Cargo.toml - Dependencies
   - gateways/api/Cargo.toml - API gateway dependencies
   - rustfmt.toml, clippy.toml, rust-toolchain.toml - Config files

3. I entered plan mode and designed a 10-step implementation plan, wrote it to the plan file, and got approval.

4. Implementation steps:
   - Step 1: Project scaffold - Cargo.toml, rustfmt.toml, clippy.toml, rust-toolchain.toml, .env.example, src/main.rs
   - Step 2: Frame type - src/frame.rs with 7 tests
   - Step 3: Database module - src/db/mod.rs + 5 migration SQL files
   - Step 4: AppState and BoardState - src/state.rs
   - Step 5: Board service - src/services/board.rs
   - Step 6: Object service - src/services/object.rs
   - Step 7: Persistence + cursor - src/services/persistence.rs, src/services/cursor.rs
   - Step 8: WebSocket handler - src/routes/mod.rs, src/routes/ws.rs, updated main.rs
   - Step 9: LLM adapter - src/llm/mod.rs, types.rs, anthropic.rs, openai.rs, tools.rs, src/services/ai.rs
   - Step 10: Deployment - Dockerfile, fly.toml

5. Errors encountered:
   - Unknown clippy lint `unnecessary_option_map_or_else` - removed from Cargo.toml
   - `sqlx::migrate!` macro not found - needed to add `migrate` and `macros` features to sqlx dependency
   - Formatting issues after all files written - fixed with `cargo fmt`

6. The user then asked to commit changes. I ran git status, git diff, and git log, but the conversation was interrupted before creating the commit.

7. Most recent state: I was about to create a git commit. The git status showed all new files as untracked. The REQUIREMENTS.md was deleted (shown as `D REQUIREMENTS.md` in initial git status). There's also a `../.DS_Store` and `PRE-SEARCH.pdf` as untracked.

Let me make sure I capture all the important code patterns and files accurately.

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested creation of a new Rust + Axum backend project for CollabBoard (a real-time collaborative whiteboard), porting patterns from the Prior project (`~/github/ianzepp/prior/`). Key constraints: focus on backend requirements only, skip authentication entirely. The PRE-SEARCH.md document (already read) defines the full architecture: Frame-based WebSocket protocol, PostgreSQL persistence, in-memory board state with LWW conflict resolution, debounced 1-second persistence flush, and multi-provider LLM adapter. After implementation was complete, the user requested a git commit.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Frame-based WebSocket protocol**: Universal message type with `{id, parent_id, ts, syscall, status, data}`, routed by syscall prefix (board:*, object:*, cursor:*, ai:*)
   - **Status lifecycle**: Request → Item* → Done (success) or Request → Error (failure), Cancel for abort
   - **LWW (Last-Write-Wins) conflict resolution**: Per-object version integers, server rejects stale updates where incoming_version < current_version
   - **Debounced persistence**: In-memory state is the hot path; dirty objects flushed to Postgres every 1 second via background tokio task
   - **Board-scoped broadcasting**: Each board has a `HashMap<Uuid, mpsc::Sender<Frame>>` for connected clients
   - **Multi-provider LLM adapter**: Anthropic Messages API + OpenAI (chat_completions + responses modes) behind an enum dispatch
   - **Axum WebSocket select! loop**: Three-channel pattern from Prior — socket.recv(), client_rx.recv() for broadcasts, writer_rx for spawned task output
   - **AppState pattern**: Clone-able shared state with PgPool + Arc<RwLock<HashMap<Uuid, BoardState>>>
   - **Stack divergence**: This project uses Rust + Axum + React instead of the Gauntlet default (Bun + Hono + htmx) because the collaborative canvas requires rich client interactivity

3. Files and Code Sections:

   **Prior project files read (reference implementations):**
   - `/Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/prior/kernel/src/frame.rs` — Frame struct, Status enum, Data type alias, ErrorCode trait, constructors (request, cancel, item, done, error, error_from), builders (with_room, with_from, with_content, with_data), prefix() routing. This was the primary reference for CollabBoard's frame.rs.
   - `/Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/prior/gateways/api/src/ws.rs` — WebSocket handler with select! loop pattern, per-connection mpsc channel, spawned relay tasks for non-blocking response streaming. Primary reference for routes/ws.rs.

   - `fly.toml` — app=collaboard, primary_region=dfw, internal_port=3000, force_https=true

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Unknown clippy lint `unnecessary_option_map_or_else`**: The lint from Prior's Cargo.toml doesn't exist in Rust 1.85. Fixed by removing the line from `[lints.clippy]` in Cargo.toml.
   - **`sqlx::migrate!` macro not found**: Initially had sqlx with only `runtime-tokio` and `postgres` features. The `migrate!` macro requires `migrate` and `macros` features. Fixed by updating Cargo.toml to: `features = ["runtime-tokio", "postgres", "migrate", "macros", "uuid", "json"]`
   - **Formatting issues**: After writing all files, `cargo fmt --check` showed many formatting differences (line width, struct literals, chain calls). Fixed by running `cargo fmt` which auto-formatted all files.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully ported Prior's frame protocol to a whiteboard domain by replacing `room: Option<String>` with `board_id: Option<Uuid>` and dropping the timeout field
   - Simplified Prior's kernel/subsystem/pipe architecture to direct Axum handlers + shared services (avoiding ~4h of unnecessary scaffolding)
   - Replaced Prior's DoorRegistry with board-scoped `HashMap<Uuid, mpsc::Sender<Frame>>` for simpler broadcasting
   - Simplified Prior's config-file-based LLM setup to environment variable-based construction
   - All 7 frame tests pass, zero clippy errors, clean formatting

6. All user messages:
   - "new project, see @PRE-SEARCH.md . focus on backend requirements, skip auth. Explore @~/github/ianzepp/prior/ for referenced patterns to extract here"
   - (Approved plan mode entry)
   - (Approved the implementation plan via ExitPlanMode)
   - "Please commit your changes."

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Create a git commit** for all the new CollabBoard backend scaffold files. The user explicitly requested "Please commit your changes." — git status/diff/log were run but the actual commit has not been created yet.

8. Current Work:
   The user requested "Please commit your changes." I ran the three prerequisite git commands:
   - `git status` — showed all files as untracked (new project), also showed `D REQUIREMENTS.md` (deleted, pre-existing), `../.DS_Store` and `PRE-SEARCH.pdf` as untracked
   - `git diff --stat` — no output (all files are untracked, not staged)
   - `git log --oneline -5` — showed recent commits: `67e45fc Move PRE-SEARCH.md to docs/`, `de7d47d Add design system spec...`, `ec98695 Add CollabBoard project brief PDF`, etc.
   
   The conversation was interrupted before I could stage files and create the commit. I need to: stage the relevant new files (excluding .DS_Store, target/, PRE-SEARCH.pdf), draft a commit message, and create the commit.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the git commit that the user explicitly requested with "Please commit your changes." I had just run `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` and was about to stage files and create the commit. The new files to stage are all the Rust source files, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, config files (.env.example, rustfmt.toml, clippy.toml, rust-toolchain.toml), Dockerfile, and fly.toml. Should exclude `../.DS_Store`, `target/`, and `PRE-SEARCH.pdf`.
