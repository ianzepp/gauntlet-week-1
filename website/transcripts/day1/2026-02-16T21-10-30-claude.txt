👤 Explore the Prior project at /Users/ianzepp/github/prior to understand its structure and key patterns that CollabBoard will port. I need to understand:

1. Overall project structure (list key directories and files)
2. The Frame type definition (src/frame.rs or similar)
3. The Axum gateway/router setup (how routes are assembled, how WS is handled)
4. The AppState / shared state pattern
5. The LLM client trait and provider dispatch pattern
6. Any service patterns (how business logic is organized)

Do NOT read every file — just enough to understand the architecture. Focus on:
- Frame struct and Status enum
- Router assembly
- WebSocket handler pattern
- State management (Arc/RwLock patterns)
- Service trait patterns

Return a concise summary of each pattern with relevant code snippets.

🤖 I'll explore the Prior project to understand its architecture and key patterns. Let me start by examining the project structure.
✅ Bash: find /Users/ianzepp/github/prior -type f -name "*.rs" | head -20
🤖 Let me check what directories exist in the gauntlet root:
✅ Bash: ls -la /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/
🤖 Let me check the parent directory and surrounding areas:
❌ Bash: ls -la /Users/ianzepp/github/
🤖 Let me try with a git command:
❌ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github && ls
