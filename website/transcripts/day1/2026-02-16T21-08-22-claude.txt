👤 ok. focusing on @collaboard/ see PRE-SEARCH.md for initial plan. Let's talk through this to confirm the MVP requirements, and then skeleton out the backend.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
🤖 Let me read the PRE-SEARCH and REQUIREMENTS docs first.

✅ Bash: rm /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/REQUIREMENTS.md
🤖 Done. REQUIREMENTS.md deleted. PRE-SEARCH.md is the single source of truth now.

So — looking at the PRE-SEARCH, the big decision to confirm before we skeleton anything out:

**The PRE-SEARCH calls for Rust + Axum + PostgreSQL + React/Konva, diverging from your CLAUDE.md defaults (Bun + Hono + SQLite + htmx).** The rationale is porting patterns from your Prior project.

🤖 Got it — **Rust + Axum + PostgreSQL (Neon) + React/Konva** as designed. The PRE-SEARCH stands.

Now let's confirm the MVP scope before skeletoning. From the PRE-SEARCH, here's what I understand as the **24-hour MVP**:

**Backend (Rust/Axum):**
- Frame type + serialization
- GitHub OAuth flow (5 endpoints)
- WS upgrade with ticket-based auth
- Frame dispatch loop (syscall routing)
- Board service (join, state hydration)
- Object service (CRUD, LWW versioning, debounced persistence)
- Cursor broadcast (ephemeral)
- Postgres schema (users, sessions, ws_tickets, boards, board_objects, frames)

**Frontend (React/Konva):**
- Login page (GitHub OAuth redirect)
- Dashboard (board list, create board)
- Board page (canvas + toolbar)
- Sticky notes, rectangles, circles, lines
- Drag, resize, rotate via Konva Transformer
- WebSocket frame client + Zustand store
- Live cursors + presence

**NOT in MVP:**
- Freehand drawing, connectors, text blocks, multi-select, AI agent, undo/redo, image upload, templates, export

Does that match your expectations, or do you want to adjust the MVP boundary before we start scaffolding?
👤 Matches. Ignore auth wiring for now. Focus on the rust skeleton. Reference the related prior project as needed.
