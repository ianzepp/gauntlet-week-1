👤 please read the pre-search and clarify the paths used that reference "prior" in the related project.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
🤖 Let me read the PRE-SEARCH document first.
✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.pdf"
🤖 Here are all the references to "Prior" in the PRE-SEARCH document and what they mean:

## What "Prior" Is

**Prior** is your personal, private Rust project (`github.com/ianzepp/prior`) — described on page 19 as:

> An agentic runtime built on a frame-based protocol where every subsystem (rooms, LLM, VFS, entity store, cache) communicates through a central kernel router using structured `Frame` messages with `{ id, parent_id, syscall, status, data }`.

## Every "Prior" Reference

1. **§3 Time to Ship (p.3)** — "Prior's proven patterns reduce the risk of architectural surprises"

2. **§5 Team & Skill Constraints (p.3)** — "Rust backend (porting proven patterns from Prior)" / "The Prior project provides a battle-tested monokernel, frame protocol, and Axum gateway pattern."

3. **§8 Database (p.5)** — `frames` table is "ported from Prior's `frame_db`" (append-only audit log schema)

4. **§8 Database (p.5)** — "SQLite (like Prior)" listed as an option considered but rejected

5. **§9 Backend Architecture (p.7)** — "Status lifecycle (identical to Prior): Request -> Item* -> Done / Request -> Error / Cancel"

6. **§11 Third-Party Integrations (p.10)** — "Prior has reference implementations for both providers" — specifically `llm/client.rs` (Anthropic) and `llm/openai_client.rs` (OpenAI)

7. **§13 File Structure (p.13-14)** — `src/frame.rs` noted as "ported from Prior", `llm/anthropic.rs` and `llm/openai.rs` both noted as "ported from Prior"

8. **§16 Tooling (p.17)** — `frames` table "ported from Prior's `frame_db`"

9. **§19 Prior Project (p.19)** — Full description block

## Specific Prior Source Paths Referenced

| Prior path | What it provides | CollabBoard target |
|---|---|---|
| `llm/client.rs` | Anthropic Messages API client | `src/llm/anthropic.rs` |
| `llm/openai_client.rs` | OpenAI Chat Completions client | `src/llm/openai.rs` |
| Frame type + `frame_db` | Frame struct, Status enum, append-only log schema | `src/frame.rs` + `frames` table |
| Axum gateway pattern | WS upgrade, frame dispatch | `src/routes/ws.rs` |
| Kernel router (conceptual) | syscall prefix → handler dispatch | Simplified to flat WS dispatch (no kernel abstraction) |
| `LlmClient` trait | Provider-agnostic LLM interface | `src/llm/mod.rs` |

The document explicitly notes that CollabBoard **does not** port Prior's kernel/subsystem abstraction layer (§9) — that would add ~4 hours of scaffolding. Instead it flattens the dispatch into standard Axum route handlers while keeping the wire-level frame protocol identical.
👤 this is correct (github.com/ianzepp/prior) for the remote repo, but the local project is stored at ~/github/ianzepp/prior/ .. are there any incorrect local path references in the doc?
🤖 The PRE-SEARCH document doesn't contain any local filesystem path references to Prior. Every Prior reference uses either:

- The remote URL (`github.com/ianzepp/prior`)
- Relative source paths within Prior's own codebase (`llm/client.rs`, `llm/openai_client.rs`, `frame_db`)

So there are no incorrect local path references to fix. The document never claims Prior lives at a specific local directory.
👤 please create a "collaboard" label for gh issues in the ianzepp/gauntlet remote repo
✅ Bash: gh label create collaboard --repo ianzepp/gauntlet --description "CollabBoard project" --color 0E8A16
🤖 Done — `collaboard` label created on `ianzepp/gauntlet`.
👤 Let's take the pre-search and split it out into issues. And a major epic for the MVP due, linked to the issues required for the MVP
🤖 Let me re-read the PRE-SEARCH to map out the MVP scope and post-MVP features clearly before creating issues.

Looking at the document, the MVP (24-hour sprint) covers:

**MVP Issues (from the time allocation table, p.2):**
1. Project scaffolding — Cargo project, Frame type, Postgres schema + migrations, AppState (Hours 0-3)
2. GitHub OAuth + session management + `/api/ws` frame relay (Hours 3-5)
3. Tests: frame serialization, session lifecycle, WS connect (Hours 5-6)
4. Board + Object services — CRUD, in-memory state, Postgres persist (Hours 6-9)
5. Tests: object CRUD, board state hydration, LWW (Hours 9-10)
6. React+Konva frontend — canvas, sticky notes, shapes, toolbar (Hours 10-14)
7. Frame client (WS), real-time sync, cursor broadcast, presence UI (Hours 14-18)
8. Tests: frame client dispatch, multi-client sync smoke test (Hours 18-19)
9. Deploy to Fly.io, integration testing, bug fixes (Hours 19-22)

**Post-MVP Issues (Days 2-7):**
10. Connectors, text objects, multi-select, rotate, board CRUD UI (Days 2-3)
11. AI agent subsystem — LLM tool calling, 6+ commands (Days 4-5)
12. Copy/paste, disconnect recovery, polish, performance (Days 6-7)

**Cross-cutting / infrastructure from the design sections:**
- Database schema (detailed in §8)
- Frame protocol (§9)
- LLM multi-provider adapter (§11)
- Security — rate limiting, CORS, XSS (§12)
- Reconnect/recovery — incremental replay (§9, post-MVP)

Let me create these now.

👤 let's talk about design elements for the front-end. there is a web app at @~/github/ianzepp/abbot-web/ with an interesting visual theme. please explore
✅ Task: Explore: "Explore abbot-web visual theme"
🤖 Here's what I found in **abbot-web**:

## Visual Theme: "Field Survey Terminal"

A retro-scientific research interface aesthetic — think 1970s-80s lab monitoring station meets modern software UI.

### Key Design Characteristics

- **Zero decoration**: No rounded corners, no drop shadows, no gradients, no blur. Pure utility.
- **Monospace everything**: IBM Plex Mono as the primary font, uppercase labels with wide letter-spacing (0.04-0.1em)
- **Handwritten accent**: Caveat (cursive) font used sparingly for specimen/entity names — gives a "field notebook" feel
- **Earthy, warm palette**:
  - Backgrounds: warm off-whites (`#F5F0E8`), creams (`#EDE8DD`), beige (`#E8E0D2`)
  - Text: dark brown (`#2C2824`), medium brown (`#8A8178`), muted tan (`#B5AEA4`)
  - Accent: forest green (`#2C6E49`) for progress/success, muted rose (`#8B4049`) for errors
  - Nav: dark charcoal-brown (`#2C2824`)
- **Full dark mode** support with inverted warm tones (deep browns instead of bright blacks)
- **High information density**: grid-based layouts, 65/35 panel splits, compact spacing
- **Tiny font sizes**: 10-13px for most UI, 42-48px for hero metrics
- **Minimal animation**: only a single `pulse` keyframe, 150ms transitions

### Layout Patterns
- Dark top nav bar (44px) with uppercase tab groups
- Timeline/grid view with 6-column rows
- Stat strips with large hero numbers + key-value breakdowns
- Inspector panel (right 35%) with specimen card + tabbed data views
- Chat/journal with two-page spread (field notes + analysis log)

### What Could Transfer to CollabBoard

This is a strong visual identity. Want me to think about how to adapt elements of this theme (the warm palette, monospace typography, zero-decoration philosophy, dark mode system) for CollabBoard's whiteboard UI? Or are you thinking of using this aesthetic directly?
👤 I want to ignore the layout aspects, and steal the design elements, adapted to a collaboard interface. Let's talk.
🤖 Good. Let me think about what translates and what needs adapting.

### What transfers cleanly

**The palette** — warm beiges/browns instead of cold grays. This is distinctive and would make CollabBoard immediately feel different from Miro/FigJam's sterile whites and blues. The forest green accent works well for presence indicators and active states.

**Monospace + uppercase for chrome** — toolbar labels, panel headers, status text. Gives the UI a distinctive voice without affecting usability. IBM Plex Mono is excellent.

**Zero decoration** — no rounded corners, no shadows, no gradients on UI chrome (toolbar, panels, nav). Clean and fast to implement.

**The dark mode system** — CSS variables with warm dark tones instead of pure blacks. Easy to wire up from day one.

### What needs rethinking for a whiteboard

**The canvas itself** — abbot-web is information-dense grids and text. CollabBoard's canvas is a spatial, visual workspace. The warm beige background could work as the canvas color (instead of white/dotted gray), but objects on the canvas (sticky notes, shapes) need to pop against it.

**Sticky note colors** — need a palette that harmonizes with the warm background. Not the typical neon yellow/pink/blue. Think muted earth tones: sage green, terracotta, dusty gold, slate blue, warm gray. Or keep bright stickies but let the chrome be earthy.

**Typography on objects** — monospace on sticky notes would be unusual. Could work for a "research lab" feel, or you could use a proportional font for object content and keep monospace for the UI shell only.

**The Caveat (handwritten) font** — this could be the sticky note font. Handwritten text on sticky notes is a natural fit and would reinforce the "field notebook" aesthetic.

### Questions for you

1. **Canvas background** — warm beige (`#E8E0D2`) with a subtle grid, or something else?
2. **Sticky note text** — Caveat (handwritten) for that field-notebook feel, or too quirky for a collaboration tool?
3. **Object colors** — earthy/muted palette to match the theme, or conventional bright stickies that contrast against the warm chrome?
4. **How far to push the retro aesthetic** — full commitment (monospace labels on everything, no rounded corners even on sticky notes), or just the chrome/toolbar while objects feel more conventional?
👤 Canvas beige with a light grid is great. Handwritten sticky notes is a great idea. No bright colors, keep everything in the theme. Full retro aesthetic, keep it cohesive.
🤖 Love it. Full commitment to the aesthetic. Let me capture this as a design spec.
✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/abbot-web/index.css"
🤖 Now let me write the design spec.
✅ Write: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/DESIGN.md"
🤖 Here's what I wrote in `DESIGN.md`. The key decisions:

**Canvas** — warm beige with a line grid (not dots), 20px spacing. Graph paper feel, like a field notebook page.

**Sticky notes** — Caveat handwriting font, sharp corners, 8 earthy colors (cream, sage, terracotta, slate, dust, gold, stone, moss). Slight random rotation (±1-2°) on creation for an organic feel. No shadows — depth comes from a 1px darker bottom/right border.

**8 user presence colors** — muted forest green, rose, dusty blue, earth brown, purple, olive, sienna, teal. All earthy enough to belong in the palette.

**Connectors** — straight lines or right-angle segments only. No curves. Fits the grid aesthetic.

**Shapes** — unfilled by default, 1px stroke, sharp corners. Can optionally fill with the same note color palette.

**10 hard rules** at the bottom: zero border-radius, zero shadows, zero gradients, all colors from variables, dark mode from day one, etc.

Anything you'd push back on or want to adjust before this becomes the reference spec?
👤 let's create docs/ and move both the .md files there plus the pdf
✅ Bash: mkdir -p /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/docs && mv /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/DESIGN.md /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.pdf /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntle...
🤖 Note that `REQUIREMENTS.md` was already deleted (shown as `D` in the git status at conversation start), so only `DESIGN.md` and `PRE-SEARCH.pdf` moved. Let me verify the result.
✅ Bash: ls -la /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/docs/
🤖 Done. `collaboard/docs/` now contains:
- `DESIGN.md` — design system spec
- `PRE-SEARCH.pdf` — architecture pre-search
👤 and commit just those changes please
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git status
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git log --oneline -5
🤖 The PRE-SEARCH.pdf was previously tracked at `collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.pdf` and is now in `collaboard/docs/`. I need to stage the delete of the old location, the new docs/ files, and the deletion of REQUIREMENTS.md.
❌ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git add collaboard/REQUIREMENTS.md collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.pdf collaboard/docs/DESIGN.md collaboard/docs/PRE-SEARCH.pdf
🤖 The PDF was untracked (shown with `??` in the original git status). So it was never committed — it just needs to be added from `docs/`.
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git add collaboard/REQUIREMENTS.md collaboard/docs/DESIGN.md collaboard/docs/PRE-SEARCH.pdf
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git diff --cached --stat
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ↵ Add design system spec and move project docs to docs/ ↵  ↵ Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com> ↵ EOF ↵ )"
🤖 Committed `de7d47d` — removes old `REQUIREMENTS.md`, adds `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/PRE-SEARCH.pdf`.
👤 where did PRE-SEARCH.md go?
🤖 Good catch. Let me check — the original git status showed `D REQUIREMENTS.md`, not PRE-SEARCH.md. Let me look at what was actually tracked before.
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git show ec98695 --stat
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git log --all --oneline -- 'collaboard/PRE-SEARCH*' 'collaboard/REQUIREMENTS*'
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git show dfbcaa8 --stat
🤖 There it is. `collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.md` was tracked in git — a 677-line markdown file across 3 commits. The `D REQUIREMENTS.md` in git status was a separate file. I moved the **PDF** (which was untracked) into docs/ but the tracked **markdown** file is now missing from the working tree.
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git show HEAD:collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.md | head -5
🤖 It's still in HEAD (never deleted from git). It just needs to be moved to `docs/`. Let me restore it and move it:
✅ Bash: cd /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet && git mv collaboard/PRE-SEARCH.md collaboard/docs/PRE-SEARCH.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ↵ Move PRE-SEARCH.md to docs/ ↵  ↵ Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply...
🤖 Fixed. `collaboard/docs/` now has all three:
- `PRE-SEARCH.md` (the tracked markdown, 677 lines)
- `PRE-SEARCH.pdf` (the PDF version)
- `DESIGN.md` (design system spec)

I missed it because the markdown file wasn't showing in `git status` — it was still cleanly tracked. Should have checked for it. Sorry about that.
👤 did you create front-end issues also?
🤖 No, I didn't create a dedicated frontend design system issue. The design spec in `DESIGN.md` doesn't have a corresponding GitHub issue to track its implementation. The frontend issue (#7) covers the React+Konva scaffolding but doesn't reference the design system.

Want me to create an issue for implementing the design system (CSS variables, fonts, theme setup, dark mode toggle) as a foundation that #7 and #8 would depend on? Or fold it into #7?
👤 please review @docs/PRE-SEARCH.md and use that as a baseline for the front-end issues, focusing on MVP requirements
🤖 Looking at the PRE-SEARCH, the frontend MVP work (Hours 10-19) is currently split across just two issues (#7 and #8) that are quite large. Let me also check what the existing issues cover to avoid duplication.
✅ Bash: gh issue list --repo ianzepp/gauntlet --label collaboard --json number,title --limit 20
🤖 Issues #5 and #2 are missing from the list — let me check.
✅ Bash: gh issue view 2 --repo ianzepp/gauntlet --json title,state && gh issue view 5 --repo ianzepp/gauntlet --json title,state
🤖 OK — #2 and #5 are already closed (work already done). The frontend issues #7 and #8 are the ones that need attention. Currently they're backend-heavy in description and don't reference the design system at all. Let me create proper frontend-specific issues that break the work down better and reference `DESIGN.md`.

| **#16** | Konva canvas, sticky notes, shapes, toolbar | #14, #15 |
| **#17** | WebSocket frame client, real-time sync, cursor presence | #14, #16, #3, #5 |

### What changed
- **#7** and **#8** closed as superseded — they were monolithic and didn't reference the design system
- **#14** is the new foundation: all CSS variables, fonts, dark mode from `DESIGN.md` must land first
- **#15** separates project setup + auth UI + dashboard from canvas work
- **#16** is pure canvas: sticky notes with Caveat font, earthy colors, sharp corners, grid background
- **#17** is the real-time wiring: frame client, sync, cursors with user colors, presence UI
- Epic #1 updated with the new structure and checked off #2 and #5 as already closed

🤖 Here's what I extracted from the G4 spec that was missing:

### New Post-MVP Issues

| # | Title | Milestone | Why |
|---|-------|-----------|-----|
| **#18** | Frames: group and organize content areas | Friday | Spec requires frames as a board feature; needed by AI complex commands (SWOT quadrants, retro columns) |
| **#19** | AI agent: full 9-tool schema + complex multi-step commands | Friday | Spec lists 9 specific tools (we had 7); explicitly tests SWOT, journey map, retro board generation |
| **#20** | Resilience testing: throttling, disconnect, 5+ users | Friday | Spec lists 5 exact test scenarios evaluators will run |
| **#21** | AI Development Log | Sunday | Required 1-page submission |
| **#22** | AI Cost Analysis | Sunday | Required: dev spend + projections at 100/1K/10K/100K users |
| **#23** | README | Sunday | Required: setup guide, architecture, deployed link |
| **#24** | Demo video (3-5 min) | Sunday | Required submission |
| **#25** | Social post | Sunday | Required: X or LinkedIn, tag @GauntletAI |

The epic (#1) now has three clear milestone sections: **Tuesday** (MVP gate), **Friday** (early/full feature set), **Sunday** (polish + documentation). Also moved the G4 spec PDF into `docs/`.
👤 let's create a project-level README.md with the architecture
🤖 Let me review the current state of docs to write an accurate README.
✅ Bash: ls /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/docs/ && ls /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/src/ 2>/dev/null
✅ Bash: ls /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/src/routes/ /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/src/services/ /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/src/llm/ /Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/colla...

✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/.env.example"
✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/src/frame.rs"
✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/src/state.rs"
🤖 Now I have a clear picture of what's actually built. Let me write the README.
✅ Write: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/gauntlet/collaboard/README.md"
🤖 Done. `README.md` covers:

- **Architecture diagram** — full client → WS → services → Postgres flow in ASCII art
- **Frame protocol** — wire format, status lifecycle, syscall routing table
- **Real-time sync** — LWW approach, server-authoritative, persistence strategy
- **AI agent** — 9 tools, complex commands, provider config
- **Design** — brief summary linking to `DESIGN.md`
- **Project structure** — actual current file layout (not aspirational)
- **Setup** — prerequisites, env, database migrations, run commands

This satisfies the README submission requirement (#23) structurally — the deployed link and any final details get filled in at the end.
👤 question: this dir "collaboard" is a subdir in the overall repo.. does .gitignore here work, or does it need to be in the parent dir?
🤖 `.gitignore` works at any level. Git respects `.gitignore` files in subdirectories — patterns in `collaboard/.gitignore` apply to files under `collaboard/`. You can have both a root-level one and a project-level one.

So `collaboard/.gitignore` is fine for project-specific ignores (like `target/`, `client/node_modules/`, etc.), and the parent repo can have its own `.gitignore` for repo-wide patterns.
