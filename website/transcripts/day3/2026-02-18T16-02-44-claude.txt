👤 Read the contents of all component files to see what's currently there:
for f in /Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1/.worktrees/leptos-ui/client-rust/src/components/*.rs; do echo "=== $f ==="; cat "$f"; echo; done
📋 Model: opus-4.6

🤖 Let me read all of them.

🤖 Here are all the component files in `/Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1/.worktrees/leptos-ui/client-rust/src/components/`:

**All 14 component files are currently stubs** — each contains only a doc comment describing its purpose, with no actual code (no structs, functions, or Leptos component definitions). The `mod.rs` file properly declares all 14 modules as public.

Here is a summary of each file:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ai_panel.rs` | AI assistant panel for prompts/responses |
| `board_card.rs` | Reusable card for board list items on dashboard |
| `board_stamp.rs` | Semi-transparent overlay label on canvas |
| `canvas_host.rs` | Bridge between Leptos UI and `canvas::Engine` (mounts `<canvas>`, wires events) |
| `chat_panel.rs` | Real-time board chat panel |
| `inspector_panel.rs` | Property inspector for selected board object |
| `left_panel.rs` | Collapsible left panel with tool rail and inspector |
| `mission_control.rs` | In-board board switcher with navigation |
| `mod.rs` | Module declarations for all 14 components |
| `right_panel.rs` | Collapsible right panel with tabs (AI, chat, boards) |
| `status_bar.rs` | Bottom bar with connection status, zoom, object count |
| `tool_rail.rs` | Vertical strip of tool selection buttons |
| `tool_strip.rs` | Quick-create buttons with shape/color presets |
| `toolbar.rs` | Top bar with board name, avatars, back/logout buttons |
| `user_field_report.rs` | User profile popover with stats |

Every file beyond `mod.rs` is essentially empty — just a `//!` doc comment with no implementation yet.
