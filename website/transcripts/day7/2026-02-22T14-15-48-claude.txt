📋 Project: /Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1

📋 Version: 2.1.50
📋 Branch: main

👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 6 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-20T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-21T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 6
DATE: 2026-02-20
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-20T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-21T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-20T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-21T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse | wc -l
🤖 Here are the results:

```
DAY: 6
DATE: 2026-02-20
TITLE: Dials, Refactors, and Polish
COMMIT_COUNT: 68
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: DIAL_CONTROL_SYSTEM
COMMITS: 10
SUMMARY: Extracted reusable dial primitives and migrated compass and zoom controls to the new system. Added object-level rotation, color, and text style dials with snap-click routing and reset controls. Unified board-level and object-level controls onto shared compass and zoom dial components.
---
NAME: CSS_AND_THEME_CLEANUP
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Split monolithic CSS into theme, base, layout, and component modules, then extracted shared side-panel primitives. Inlined CSS imports to eliminate runtime 404s and collapsed unused split CSS duplicates into stubs.
---
NAME: CANVAS_HOST_REFACTOR
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Broke the canvas host into smaller modules for dial math, object prop helpers, frame emission, selection metrics, and shape placement presets. Extracted viewport/presence helpers and selection actions into shared modules, then removed unused transform code.
---
NAME: FRAME_CLIENT_REFACTOR
COMMITS: 6
SUMMARY: Decomposed the frame client into dedicated submodules for parsing helpers, AI handlers, error handling, and chat/object/request concerns. Applied rustfmt across all refactored files and fixed hydrate recursion introduced by the reorganization.
---
NAME: MINIMAP_AND_VIEWPORT
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Replaced the station log with a bare top-right minimap overlay and added draggable viewport controls. Stabilized minimap drag with pointer snapshot mapping and fixed click-vs-drag interaction, then ultimately made the minimap read-only after the drag UX proved too fragile.
---
NAME: OBJECT_TEXT_AND_PROMPTS
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Added an object text edit modal triggered by canvas double-click with auto-close on selection clear. Refactored board prompt parsing and extracted the prompt bar into a dedicated component. Refined prompt preview flow, typography, and inline read-more behavior.
---
NAME: IMPORT_EXPORT_AND_INFRA
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Added board JSONL export and import endpoints with corresponding toolbar actions, enabling web-sys file input features for the import flow. Included the traces crate in the Docker build context and added a requirements checklist with deployment URL to the README.
---
NAME: CLIENT_TESTING_AND_CLEANUP
COMMITS: 6
SUMMARY: Added broad client test coverage for util, pages, state, and net helpers, then refactored client helpers for testability and expanded unit coverage. Deduplicated unauthenticated redirect logic, shared hex color normalization across canvas and inspector, and extracted a shared request frame builder for client syscalls.
---
NAME: MULTI_SELECT_AND_UX_POLISH
COMMITS: 9
SUMMARY: Implemented multi-select canvas interactions with persisted grouping and added a consistent bullseye placement ghost for shape tools. Added public board visibility toggle, users panel follow controls, status-bar help modal, and default colors for sticky notes and circles. Miscellaneous polish included refining dial handles to circular edge-centered knobs and reducing cursor backlog noise in traces.
