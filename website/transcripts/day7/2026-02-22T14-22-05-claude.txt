👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 7 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-22T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-23T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters. For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 7
DATE: 2026-02-22
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max.

DAY: 7
DATE: 2026-02-22
TITLE: Tracing and Portfolio Site
COMMIT_COUNT: 9
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: FRAME_TRACE_PROMOTION
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Promoted the trace field from a nested data property to a top-level frame field with backend gating. Added auto-enabling of trace config before board list requests and removed the legacy data.trace read fallbacks that were no longer needed.
---
NAME: PORTFOLIO_SITE_LAUNCH
COMMITS: 2
SUMMARY: Built a vintage "Field Survey Terminal" aesthetic portfolio site in plain HTML/CSS/JS and mounted it at the root path, relocating the Leptos SSR app to /app. Fixed routing issues from the migration and aligned live demo links to the new path structure.
---
NAME: PORTFOLIO_POLISH_AND_NAV
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Closed visual gaps between the portfolio implementation and design spec, adjusting font sizes, carousel arrows, dot grid opacity, transitions, and adding missing CSS variables. Added hash-based URL routing so nav items update the address bar and browser back/forward buttons work correctly.
---
NAME: TIMELINE_COMMIT_LOG
COMMITS: 1
SUMMARY: Replaced the placeholder screenshot carousel in the timeline view with a vertically scrolling commit log panel showing themed clusters for each of the seven build days. Each day displays actual git history with day-switching via arrows and keyboard nav, and field notes synced to the selected day.
