👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 4 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-18T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-19T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 4
DATE: 2026-02-18
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-18T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-19T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
🤖 Now let me look at the commit details more closely for a few clusters that need clarification.

TITLE: Leptos Client Full Integration
COMMIT_COUNT: 84
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: DESIGN_DOCS_AND_SCAFFOLDING
COMMITS: 6
SUMMARY: Refreshed the README and drafted the konva-to-rust design doc, then revised it after review with a public API boundary section. Added the canvas crate scaffold with 131 passing tests and established project hygiene ground rules.
---
NAME: CANVAS_ENGINE_CORE
COMMITS: 11
SUMMARY: Implemented hit-testing with 99 geometry tests, the input state machine with 55 edge-case tests, and the render/draw pipeline with full Canvas2D output. Fixed resize accumulation and text action semantics bugs along the way, extracted shared constants, and added doc comments to all public items.
---
NAME: LEPTOS_CLIENT_PHASES
COMMITS: 12
SUMMARY: Built the Leptos 0.8 + Axum SSR client across eight sequential phases: scaffold, SSR integration, pages/auth/REST, WebSocket frame client, toolbar/statusbar, left panel, right panel, and dark mode polish. Merged the leptos-ui branch into main after all phases landed.
---
NAME: SERVER_TESTS_AND_TOOLCHAIN
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Added 102 new server tests across multiple test files and centralized the Rust toolchain configuration. Fixed duplicate Cargo.toml sections, aligned rust-version across all crates and the Dockerfile, and resolved Docker build issues including openssl-sys compilation and cargo-leptos WASM targets.
---
NAME: CLIENT_UI_RESTRUCTURE
COMMITS: 10
SUMMARY: Rewrote the client stylesheet to a React-token-based UI system and restructured both left and right panels. Wired WebSocket board join/list/create flows, normalized frame parsing, polished toolbar and dashboard interactions, and applied rustfmt across component files.
---
NAME: CANVAS_BROWSER_INTEGRATION
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Mounted the canvas engine in the browser and wired pointer, wheel, and keyboard events for pan/zoom/select interaction. Propagated canvas actions to WebSocket object mutation frames, centered the world origin at viewport center, and fixed rotated resize handle drift by computing in local space.
---
NAME: MULTIPLAYER_PRESENCE
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Implemented remote cursor rendering with server cursor frame support and added ephemeral object:drag sync for live move/resize/rotate broadcasting. Built adaptive drag interpolation, stale cursor expiry, and conflict guards for the full collaborative presence lifecycle.
---
NAME: PLACEMENT_TOOLS_AND_SHAPES
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Replaced the tool flyout with a click-to-place ghost preview workflow and enabled circle, line, and arrow placement tools. Added shape attachment points for line endpoints, rendered attached endpoint markers, and fixed duplicate local object creation on place.
---
NAME: FRAMES_AND_POLISH
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Added frames grouping with persistent rail tooltips and a savepoint/record-shelf rewind timeline. Implemented grouped transform rotation for frame contents, unified canvas background grid rendering, and shipped a YouTube TV embed object as an easter egg.
