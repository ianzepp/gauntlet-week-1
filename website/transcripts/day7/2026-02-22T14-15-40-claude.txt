📋 Project: /Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1
📋 Started: 2026-02-22T14:15:40.133+00:00
📋 Version: 2.1.50
📋 Branch: main

👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 3 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-17T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-18T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 3
DATE: 2026-02-17
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-17T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-18T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
🤖 Now let me get the count and review some of the commits in more detail to ensure accurate clustering.

🤖 Here are the results:

```
DAY: 3
DATE: 2026-02-17
TITLE: Canvas Rebuild and Panel Layout
COMMIT_COUNT: 76
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: WEBSOCKET_ERROR_HANDLING
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Added error logging for failed WebSocket frames on both server and client sides. Centralized the outbound WebSocket frame path to reduce duplication.
---
NAME: SERVER_TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Moved server tests into dedicated *_test.rs files per project convention. Added integration test suites for WebSocket AI flows, multi-user board sync, board service syscalls, and chat/history syscalls. Trimmed formatting issues in test modules.
---
NAME: RIGHT_PANEL_REDESIGN
COMMITS: 12
SUMMARY: Replaced the right panel toggle with an always-visible collapsed icon rail, then iterated heavily on its layout — extracting tabs for Boards, Chat, AI, and Inspector. Added real-time chat messaging, MissionControl board switcher, and open/close chevron before ultimately moving the inspector out to a new left panel.
---
NAME: CANVAS_GUTTING_AND_REBUILD
COMMITS: 10
SUMMARY: Gutted the existing canvas implementation and replaced it with a full-viewport layer featuring grid overlay, pan/zoom, and coordinate display. Rebuilt rectangle creation, selectable dragging, hit-testing, inline text editing, and sticky note support from scratch. Added multi-user cursor tracking and rendering.
---
NAME: AI_AND_CHAT_FEATURES
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Added chat:history and ai:history syscalls, feeding recent conversation history into LLM context scoped to the authenticated user. Rendered markdown in AI responses, switched to monospace font, and added empty-state messages. Fixed AI tool mutations to use current object versions and broadcast status correctly.
---
NAME: GRID_AND_VIEWPORT_LAYOUT
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Added Battleship-style grid coordinates to the viewport, wrapped labels on all four sides, and introduced a formal z-index layering system via CSS custom properties. After struggling with grid gutter attachment over rails, reverted that approach and ultimately removed the grid overlay UI entirely while keeping server-side grid utilities.
---
NAME: DEPLOYMENT_AND_DEVOPS
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Added run-dev.sh and switched local dev to Docker Compose. Prepared Fly.io deployment image with release workflow, ORD region config, and Dockerfile DB migrations, then later removed the Fly config entirely. Renamed the project from collaboard to gauntlet-week-1 and isolated tests from the live database.
---
NAME: INSPECTOR_AND_VISUAL_POLISH
COMMITS: 9
SUMMARY: Added inspector controls for font size and border width, moved presence chips to the top bar, and merged the tool rail into a unified left panel. Added confirmed delete with keyboard shortcut, styled the delete button, and reduced inspector panel width. Tuned selection ring animation and rebalanced canvas grid contrast in final polish passes.
---
NAME: DASHBOARD_AND_BOARD_MANAGEMENT
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Added a board dashboard page with album grid layout, displaying board names instead of UUIDs. Extracted a BoardCard component, fixed board list reload issues, and maintained full presence state from join/part broadcasts.
---
NAME: MISC_CONFIG_AND_DOCS
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Added runtime tuning knobs and documented environment configuration, then logged sanitized startup config. Updated the README to reflect current architecture. Ran cargo fmt and clippy, deleted .env.example, and fixed minor frontend selection and formatting bugs.
