👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 7 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-21T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-22T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 7
DATE: 2026-02-21
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-21T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-22T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
🤖 Now let me get the count and review the commits more closely for thematic grouping.
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-21T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-22T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse | wc -l
🤖 Here are the results:

```
DAY: 7
DATE: 2026-02-21
TITLE: Performance, CLI, and AI Tools
COMMIT_COUNT: 52
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: HOUSEKEEPING_AND_STATS
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Ran a correctness audit fixing clippy warnings and panic-capable code across the workspace, then added missing doc comments to all public items. Built project stats and code coverage scripts, wired their output tables into the README.
---
NAME: TESTING_HARDENING
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Extracted pure server logic into testable functions and wrote comprehensive unit tests for it. Added exhaustive edge-case tests across canvas, frames, and traces crates, then fixed compile errors surfaced by the surgeon pass.
---
NAME: TOOLBAR_AND_PROFILE_UI
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Added responsive toolbar toggles and a user profile modal with clipboard support. Iterated on the toolbar user area design — name badge, info icon, logout button — fixing layout centering and matching button styles across several refinement passes.
---
NAME: CLI_AND_STRESS_TOOLING
COMMITS: 4
SUMMARY: Stood up an initial CLI crate with clap subcommands covering REST board CRUD and WebSocket JSONL object streaming. Added a stress JSONL generator with a spiral pattern mode and reduced WS frame log verbosity for bulk load scenarios.
---
NAME: CANVAS_PERFORMANCE
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Tackled large-board rendering performance end to end: disabled auto savepoints during bulk loads, added join/render timing metrics, gated scene sync on revision numbers, and coalesced redraws with requestAnimationFrame. Introduced spatial bucket indexing with viewport culling, a dedicated selected-objects render pass, and disabled the minimap on large boards.
---
NAME: CANVAS_INPUT_FIXES
COMMITS: 4
SUMMARY: Fixed a tool-switch pan jump bug and moved the default viewport origin to top-left. Added a hand (pan) tool across UI and canvas input, and preserved camera state across canvas host re-initialization to prevent viewport resets.
---
NAME: AI_TOOL_SCHEMA_CLEANUP
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Refactored server LLM config and centralized provider wiring, then methodically aligned AI tool schemas with canonical UI object properties. Removed legacy batch operations, shape aliases, and youtube_embed, enforcing a single canonical prop schema with strokeWidth and user_name/user_color presence fields.
---
NAME: SVG_AI_TOOLS_AND_VIEWPORT
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Defined Phase 1 SVG AI tool schemas and implemented their execution path, plumbing svg objects through to the canvas renderer from inline path markup. Added streaming of ai:prompt tool and text updates as item frames, cached per-client viewport state on the server, and injected live viewport geometry into the AI system prompt context.
