📋 Project: /Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1
📋 Started: 2026-02-22T14:15:34.856+00:00
📋 Version: 2.1.50
📋 Branch: main

👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 1 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-15T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-16T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 1
DATE: 2026-02-15
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-15T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-16T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
🤖 No commits were returned. Let me check what date range the commits actually fall in.
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s %ai" --reverse | head -40
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s %ai" --reverse | tail -80
🤖 The commits are dated starting 2026-02-16, not 2026-02-15. Day 1 is February 16. Let me get the Day 1 commits with the correct date.
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-16T00:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-17T00:00:00-05:00" --reverse

🤖 Here are the results:

```
DAY: 1
DATE: 2026-02-16
TITLE: Full-stack scaffold and integration
COMMIT_COUNT: 40
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: PLANNING_AND_DESIGN_DOCS
COMMITS: 6
SUMMARY: Created the Pre-Search document covering auth, sync, persistence, and reconnect strategies, then iterated on it through two review passes. Added the project brief PDF and design system spec, organizing all docs into a dedicated docs/ directory.
---
NAME: BACKEND_AND_FRONTEND_SCAFFOLD
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Stood up the Rust/Axum backend scaffold and React/Vite/Konva frontend in parallel, then restructured the backend into server/ and wired up the AI agent loop with WebSocket dispatch. Added .gitignore, README, and moved specs into docs/.
---
NAME: AI_SERVICE_AND_TOOLS
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Built the LLM multi-provider adapter with rate limiting and prompt injection defense. Defined object service tool definitions, then replaced 7 consolidated AI tools with 9 spec-matching tools. Fixed an AI bug where it got stuck on "thinking" by filtering thinking blocks.
---
NAME: AUTH_AND_REALTIME_SYNC
COMMITS: 4
SUMMARY: Added GitHub OAuth authentication with env var configuration. Wired up WebSocket real-time sync with cursor presence broadcasting, giving the board live multi-user awareness from day one.
---
NAME: PERSISTENCE_LAYER
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Implemented buffered frame persistence to a frames table, then rapidly iterated on the flush strategy — tightening the interval from 1s to 100ms, switching to sleep-after-flush, then removing the buffer entirely to persist frames directly on send. Fixed Frame deserialization issues around null handling and UUID validation.
---
NAME: UI_LAYOUT_AND_TOOLING
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Redesigned the UI with a left tool rail, tabbed right panel, and board stamp. Added placeholder tools for line, arrow, text, draw, and eraser. Built the AI chat panel as a collapsible sidebar and added Transformer-based selection/resize on canvas objects.
---
NAME: USER_PRESENCE_AND_PROFILES
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Added user field report popovers on status bar chips showing per-user activity stats. Fixed the feature by stamping user_id on frames and querying board_objects, then patched profile stats to query in-memory boards alongside legacy frame data.
---
NAME: INFRA_AND_BUGFIXES
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Added docker-compose for local deployment, loaded .env via dotenvy, and configured Axum to serve frontend static files with SPA fallback. Fixed canvas object selection/resize/transform bugs and added structured logging for frame and AI prompt debugging.
