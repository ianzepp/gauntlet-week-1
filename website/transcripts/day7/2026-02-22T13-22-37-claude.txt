📋 Project: /Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1
📋 Started: 2026-02-22T13:22:37.677+00:00
📋 Version: 2.1.50
📋 Branch: main

👤 I'd like to do a public facing website (non-auth) for this project, basic html/css (no leptos), and probably copy it to docker public/ during build?
📋 Model: opus-4.6
🤖 Let me explore the current project structure to understand what we're working with.
✅ Task: Explore: "Explore project structure"
🤖 Good overview. The project already has a Leptos SSR frontend with an empty `public/` dir and a Docker setup. Let me check the current `public/` directory and how Leptos routes are configured.
✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1/server/src/routes/mod.rs"
✅ Read: file="/Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1/Dockerfile"
✅ Bash: ls -la /Users/ianzepp/github/ianzepp/gauntlet-week-1/public/
🤖 Now I understand the setup. The Leptos SSR app currently owns all frontend routing, and `public/` feeds into the Leptos build pipeline. Here's what I'm thinking:

👤 Before you design, also read this skill: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/refs/heads/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md
✅ WebFetch: url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/refs/heads/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md"
🤖 Good, I've read the frontend design skill. Now let me continue planning — I already know the answers (project portfolio, same server/separate routes). Let me design this properly.
✅ Task: Explore: "Explore Axum static serving"
🤖 Now I have everything I need. Let me write the plan.
✅ Write: file="/Users/ianzepp/.claude/plans/nifty-sauteeing-creek.md"

🤖 What would you like to clarify about those questions?
👤 I had desktop-claude generate a design doc, please review: @docs/collabboard-portfolio-design-spec.md
🤖 That's an incredibly thorough design spec — the "Field Survey Terminal" aesthetic is a strong, distinctive concept. The content mapping from the paleontology reference to a build sprint narrative is clever.

A few practical observations before I update the plan:

1. **This is a big site** — 5 pages (Overview, Architecture, Timeline, Stack, Demo) with tab switching, carousels, stat counters, and responsive breakpoints. The spec calls for vanilla JS for interactivity.

2. **The CSS architecture alone is 7 files** — variables, reset, typography, layout, components, pages, utilities.

3. **Asset dependencies** — the spec notes screenshots for Days 1-7, Loom embeds, a live demo URL, an architecture diagram, and day-by-day narrative content. Do you have these ready, or should we build a scaffold with placeholder content first?
✅ AskUserQuestion: {"questions":[{"header":"Scope","multiSelect":false,"options":[{"description":"Build the complete 5-page structure with all components, using placehol...
🤖 Good — full build with placeholders, portfolio at `/`, Leptos app at `/app`. Let me finalize the plan.
👤 [Request interrupted by user]
👤 One more thing: see @README.md .. the design used that file as a reference so a lot of your links are in there
🤖 Good — the README has all the real content: stats, crate descriptions, demo URLs, Loom links, tech stack. That eliminates most placeholder needs. Let me update the plan with this context.
