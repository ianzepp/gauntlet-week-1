📋 Branch: main

👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 2 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-16T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-17T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 2
DATE: 2026-02-16
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-16T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-17T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
🤖 Now let me get the count and review the commits more carefully.
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-16T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-17T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse | wc -l
🤖 Here are the results:

```
DAY: 2
DATE: 2026-02-16
TITLE: Full-Stack Scaffold and Wiring
COMMIT_COUNT: 40
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: PRE_SEARCH_AND_DESIGN_DOCS
COMMITS: 6
SUMMARY: Drafted and iterated on the CollabBoard pre-search document covering budget, auth, architecture, and testing strategy. Added the project brief PDF, design system spec, and organized all docs into a docs/ directory.
---
NAME: BACKEND_AND_FRONTEND_SCAFFOLD
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Stood up the Rust/Axum backend scaffold and the React/Vite/Konva frontend scaffold. Moved backend into server/, added the AI agent loop and WebSocket dispatch entry points, and added a README.
---
NAME: AI_SERVICE_AND_TOOLING
COMMITS: 4
SUMMARY: Built the LLM multi-provider adapter with object service and tool definitions. Added rate limiting and prompt injection defense, then replaced the consolidated tool set with 9 spec-matching tools per issue #28.
---
NAME: AUTH_AND_REALTIME_SYNC
COMMITS: 4
SUMMARY: Implemented GitHub OAuth authentication with env var configuration. Wired up WebSocket real-time sync with cursor presence broadcasting across connected clients.
---
NAME: PERSISTENCE_LAYER
COMMITS: 6
SUMMARY: Added buffered frame persistence to the frames table, then tightened the flush interval from 1s to 100ms and switched to sleep-after-flush. Later removed the buffer entirely in favor of direct DB persistence on each inbound frame, and added cursor frame filtering to skip unnecessary writes.
---
NAME: UI_LAYOUT_AND_FRONTEND
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Redesigned the UI with a left tool rail, tabbed right panel, and board stamp. Added the AI chat panel as a collapsible sidebar, placeholder drawing tools, and Transformer-based selection/resize with canvas polish.
---
NAME: USER_STATS_AND_PROFILES
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Added user field report popovers on status bar chips showing per-user activity. Fixed profile stats to stamp user_id on frames and query both in-memory boards and legacy frame data.
---
NAME: BUG_FIXES_AND_INFRA
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Fixed a stream of integration issues: Frame deserialization with null handling and valid UUIDs, AI "stuck on thinking" from unfiltered blocks, and canvas object selection/transform bugs. Added dotenvy for .env loading, structured logging for debugging, static file serving with SPA fallback, and a docker-compose file.
