👤 Analyze all git commits for Day 5 of the CollabBoard build sprint. Run this command to get all commits:

```
git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-19T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-20T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
```

Then group the commits into thematic clusters (don't list every commit individually — group related work together). For each cluster, write a brief field-note style entry (2-3 sentences, written like a build log / engineering journal, past tense, factual, concise). 

Return your results in this exact format:
```
DAY: 5
DATE: 2026-02-19
TITLE: [short 3-5 word title for the day's main theme]
COMMIT_COUNT: [number]
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: [cluster name in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES]
COMMITS: [count of commits in this cluster]
SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence field note]
---
NAME: ...
```

Keep cluster names to 3-5 words max. Aim for 4-8 clusters depending on how much happened.
📋 Model: opus-4.6
✅ Bash: git log --format="%h %s" --after="2026-02-19T02:00:00-05:00" --before="2026-02-20T02:00:00-05:00" --reverse
🤖 Now let me get a bit more detail on some of the clusters to confirm groupings.

DAY: 5
DATE: 2026-02-19
TITLE: Observability, AI Tools, and Rotation
COMMIT_COUNT: 104
CLUSTERS:
---
NAME: PRESENCE_AND_STATION_LOG
COMMITS: 8
SUMMARY: Unified cursor and camera presence by client connection and built out the station log roster with sort order, self-row styling, and follow/jump controls. Hardened the board join and telemetry flow, added camera lock UX polish, and removed the old header presence list in favor of the station log.
---
NAME: CRATE_MIGRATION_AND_PROTOBUF
COMMITS: 7
SUMMARY: Restructured the workspace from two crates to three (client/server/canvas), removed the legacy React build pipeline, and rewrote the README for the Rust-only architecture. Migrated the WebSocket frame transport to a shared protobuf frames crate with wire protocol documentation and edge-case codec tests.
---
NAME: CANVAS_ROTATION_AND_COMPASS
COMMITS: 9
SUMMARY: Implemented viewport-centered camera rotation math and rotated canvas rendering with a compass view control. Synced rotation state through presence and follow mode, added compass snapping with a QA matrix, and fixed pointer-event closure reuse and visibility bugs in the compass widget.
---
NAME: AI_TOOLS_AND_YAML_GRAMMAR
COMMITS: 12
SUMMARY: Built an AI assistant integration with markdown rendering, session-scoped context, and a strict quoted-YAML shape grammar for LLM I/O. Added an applyChangesYaml parser/executor, routed tool calls through a shared syscall dispatcher, and wired the board prompt bar to AI with inline request status. Extracted the system prompt to markdown and added a parallel batch tool for LLM orchestration.
---
NAME: OBSERVABILITY_AND_TRACING
COMMITS: 14
SUMMARY: Added a traces crate with derivation helpers and a client-side trace view UI. Linked AI tool calls and object frames into a prompt trace tree, emitted per-round LLM request spans with metrics, and enforced trace envelope metadata across all AI and mutation frames. Iterated heavily on the trace UI — filtering empty sessions, adding sortable columns, simplifying the context panel, and hiding chrome in trace mode.
---
NAME: BOARD_MANAGEMENT_AND_SHARING
COMMITS: 9
SUMMARY: Added board snapshot mini-previews to the dashboard, hover-delete with confirm dialogs, and broadcast of board deletes that eject connected clients. Implemented board list refresh fanout with revision-token polling, board member ACLs with management routes, and a 6-character access code sharing flow.
---
NAME: AUTH_AND_LOGIN_FLOW
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Added email-code authentication using Resend delivery with a template, and showed the dynamic auth method in UI headers. Fixed OAuth navigation on the login page, resolved the dashboard auth flash, and simplified the login title styling.
---
NAME: CANVAS_AND_UI_POLISH
COMMITS: 11
SUMMARY: Added first-class text shapes across canvas, client, and AI tooling, and anchored the prompt bar to the canvas. Refined zoom wheel interaction with center-reset behavior, replaced the status bar zoom menu with a dial control, and removed the canvas grid-dot background. Unified dashboard actions, fixed board overlay edge spacing, and applied theme consistency across light and dark modes with earthy highlight accents.
---
NAME: PERF_BENCHMARKS
COMMITS: 3
SUMMARY: Added a perf crate with end-to-end, algorithmic complexity, and mass-user benchmarks. Configured auth bypass for local perf runs and improved output with count-matrix rows and JSON summaries.
---
NAME: FRAME_PARSING_AND_PERSISTENCE
COMMITS: 5
SUMMARY: Refactored the client-side Rust frame parsing with expanded test coverage and fixed protobuf numeric decoding for board join with regression tests. Hardened board membership transitions, persistence correctness, and token handling. Refactored board WebSocket ops into dedicated handlers with a thinner op dispatcher.
